# BreakoutClone

A reimplementation of the classic game called Breakout, based on the famous [OpenGL tutorial series](https://learnopengl.com/In-Practice/2D-Game/Breakout).

I implemented the game using the C programming language, in OpenGL, using SDL2 as the platform independent window manager.

## Requirements

The project has the following dependencies:
- make
- gcc
- [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/)
- OpenGL

## Build

```
$ cd BreakoutClone
$ make clean && make
```

## Run

```
$ make run
```
